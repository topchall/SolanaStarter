Build &amp; Deploy a Solana Smart Contract using Anchor
# Differences Solana and Ethereum
Solana’s goal is to separate code and data. This means the logic could be applied to other pieces of data. That’s why Solana programs are considered stateless contracts.
# What does the program do?
The main purpose of this Solana program is for a user to write a tweet. The requirements for this program are:

- Only one person can write a tweet
- The tweet’s message cannot be empty
- The tweet can be liked by up to 5 different users
- A user cannot like a tweet more than once
- These requirements are pretty standard.
